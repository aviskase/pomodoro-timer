pomodoro-timer
==============

Another Qt-based Pomodoro Timer. It's very simple, all it can is to inform you when its time left.

Currently pomodoro-timer is tray-icon only application. It means that it has no window, all you have for communicating with it is a tray icon and context menu.

Using context menu you can set timer to different intervals:
  - Start pomodoro (25m);
  - Start coffee break (5m);
  - Start long break (30m).

Also you can pause and get to know how much time left.
